## 2017 Vehicle Fatalities Analysis  

### Introduction  

Given the NHTSA statistics for national vehicle fatalities in 2017, is it possible to identify the predominant causes? Conversely, is it possible to identify variables that do not reflect a direct cause?

#### Exploratory Data Analysis  

* Explore data and data schema. Histograms were also employed.
* Descriptive analysis
* Probability Mass Function (PMF) - Comparison of PMF for accidents that took place on Wednesdays and Saturdays, and the hour in which they occurred.
* Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) - Taking two data points, the `CDF` tells us that about 20% of the data points are between midnight and 5am. In the same fashion, about 20% are between 8pm and midnight.
* Hypothesis testing, employing `Pearson's Correlation`
* Regression Analysis
